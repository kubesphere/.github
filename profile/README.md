KubeSphere is a distributed operating system for cloud-native application management, using Kubernetes as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing third-party applications to be seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem.

There are 3 open-source projects that are not under the KubeSphere GitHub organization, but are also open-sourced and maintained by the KubeSphere team.

- [OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction): Cloud-native FaaS (Function as a Service) platform built on Knative, Dapr, KEDA, and Buildpacks.
- [OpenELB (CNCF Sandbox)](https://github.com/openelb/openelb): Load balancer implementation for Kubernetes in bare-metal, edge, and virtualization.
- [Fluentbit Operator](https://github.com/fluent/fluentbit-operator): Facilitate the deployment of Fluent Bit and provides great flexibility in building a logging layer based on Fluent Bit.
